# Mouse Accuracy Tester

A web-based mouse accuracy testing application that measures precision and reaction time with pixel-perfect accuracy tracking.

## Features

### üéØ Precision Testing
- **Pixel-Perfect Accuracy**: Uses Chebyshev distance calculation for discrete pixel ring measurements
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Targets decrease in size throughout the test
- **Real-time Statistics**: Track accuracy percentage and response time for each click

### üéÆ Multiple Difficulty Modes

**Easy Mode** (41px - 17px targets)
- 5√ó5 pixel perfect accuracy zone (25 pixels)
- Ideal for beginners or casual testing

**Medium Mode** (29px - 11px targets)
- 3√ó3 pixel perfect accuracy zone (9 pixels)
- Balanced challenge for intermediate users

**Hard Mode** (15px - 3px targets)
- Exact center pixel only (1√ó1 perfect zone)
- Ultimate precision challenge

### üìê Resolution Options
Choose from 8 different screen resolutions or fullscreen mode:
- Fullscreen (adaptive to your display)
- 3840√ó2160 (4K UHD)
- 2560√ó1440 (QHD)
- 2048√ó1152
- 1920√ó1080 (Full HD)
- 1536√ó864
- 1440√ó900
- 1366√ó768

The test area is visually constrained and centered when using specific resolutions, with automatic validation if selected resolution exceeds your screen size.

### üìä Comprehensive Results

After completing the test, view detailed statistics including:
- Overall average accuracy and response time
- Per-size group statistics
- Individual click data with accuracy, response time, and pixel distance
- Difficulty mode and resolution information

## How It Works

### Accuracy Calculation

The application uses **Chebyshev distance** (maximum of X and Y pixel differences) to create discrete "rings" around the center pixel. This provides more intuitive accuracy measurements than Euclidean distance.

**Difficulty-Based Perfect Zones:**
- Clicks within the perfect zone receive 100% accuracy
- Beyond the perfect zone, accuracy decays linearly to 0% at the target edge
- Different difficulties have different perfect zone sizes, making them progressively more challenging

### Test Flow

1. **Select Resolution**: Choose your preferred test area size
2. **Select Difficulty**: Pick Easy, Medium, or Hard mode
3. **Countdown**: 5-second countdown with audio beep
4. **Testing**: Click 16 targets (4 sizes √ó 4 rounds each)
   - Audio beep signals transitions to smaller target sizes
5. **Results**: Review comprehensive statistics and accuracy metrics
